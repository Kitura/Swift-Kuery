# An input file for simpleOperators.sh that generates global operators for simple conditions that return Filter and Having clauses.
# This file contains the operators.
# The generated code is in Sources/FilterAndHaving_GlobalFunctions.swift.

# An input file for subqueries.sh that generates global operators with subqueries (i.e. 'expression operator ANY/ALL(subquery)').
# The generated code is in Sources/Subqueries_GlobalFunctionsAndExtensions.swift.

# This is also an input file for testSimpleOperators.sh that generates the tests for the code created by simpleOperators.sh.
# The generated tests are in TestFilterAndHaving.swift

# This is also an input file for testSubquries.sh that generates the tests for the code created by subqueries.sh.
# The generated tests are in TestSubqueries.swift
